# Recipes
[JAVA BACKEND DEVELOPER COURSE by IntelliJ JetBrains](https://hyperskill.org/projects/180)

>Recipes is a graduate project for track Java Backend Developer.
Graduate projects contain core topics for this track. You need to apply core topics in project stages to verify your knowledge. At least one graduate project is required to complete the track.

### About
An urge to cook something special is too hard to resist sometimes. But what if you lost the recipe? Or your beloved grandma is too busy to answer a call and remind you of your favorite cake recipe? Let's make a program that stores all recipes in one place. Create a multi-user web service with Spring Boot that allows storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting recipes.
